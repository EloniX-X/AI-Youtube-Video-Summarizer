# AI-Youtube-Video-Summarizer
woa my first ai tool

this was actually crazy easy to make I just downloaded the captions then ran it through chatgpt

i learned a bit but mainly about the gpt api that i'll be using a lot

to change your video look at the end and change the srt = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript("pJwR5pv0_gs", languages=['en']) change 'pJwR5pv0_gs' to the end of your yt vid im gonna change it soon to have a gui and stuff gn love <3
